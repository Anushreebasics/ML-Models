# Android Malware Detection
The research project focuses on developing and evaluating machine learning models for the accurate detection of Android malware, acknowledging the serious threats posed by the proliferation of malicious software. The primary goal is to assess the performance of various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Logistics Regression, KNNs, and Sequential Neural Networks, against a user-specific dataset. The project encompasses meticulous data collection, preprocessing of both malicious and non-malicious applications, and the use of modern feature extraction and preprocessing techniques. The performance of each model is measured in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, with the Sequential Neural Network (SNN) identified as the most accurate. The study emphasizes the diverse forms of malware, their motivations, and the potential risks they pose to individuals, organizations, and even critical industries. In the context of the ever-evolving digital landscape, the research underscores the importance of a multi-faceted approach to combat malware, combining cybersecurity measures, software development excellence, user training, and sophisticated detection and prevention tools. By delving into the realm of Android malware detection, the research aims to contribute to advancing cybersecurity and creating a safer digital environment for all users.
